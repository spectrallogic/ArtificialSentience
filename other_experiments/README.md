# Testing Directory

This folder contains **experimental and educational code** created by Alan Hourmand while learning the fundamentals of transformer architectures and human-like AI design.  

## Purpose

- Serve as a **sandbox** for trying out minimal transformer implementations.  
- Explore how models behave on small datasets and custom setups.  
- Provide personal reference material for understanding attention, embeddings, and training loops.  

## Disclaimer

The code in this directory is **not intended for production use**.  
It may be unoptimized, incomplete, or oversimplified by design. The goal is educational exploration — helping me better understand how to train, debug, and experiment with AI architectures at the smallest possible scale.  

## Notes for Visitors

If you’re browsing this repository:  
- Expect rough experiments rather than polished frameworks.   
- Feedback and discussion are welcome in the main repo, but please view this folder as a **learning notebook** rather than a final product.
