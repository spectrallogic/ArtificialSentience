# ArtificialSentience

ArtificialSentience is a research project by **Alan Hourmand** dedicated to building a human-like AI system.  
This repository is the foundation for designing, training, and iterating on models that push beyond conventional machine learning.

## Vision

ArtificialSentience explores a transformer-inspired architecture modeled after aspects of the human mind.

**Key focuses:**
- **Parallel Thinking** — multiple reasoning streams working in unison
- **Emotional Modeling** — simulated affective states to shape responses and goals
- **Purpose & Growth** — long-term objectives, self-improvement, and adaptive learning
- **Abstraction** — the ability to generalize and operate on higher-level concepts

The aim is to move toward **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)** that combines advanced reasoning with empathy and human alignment. By merging capability with compassion, ArtificialSentience investigates how AI can develop intelligence while maintaining safety, trust, and meaningful collaboration with people.

## Development

This repo will host:
- Experimental transformer architectures modeled after cognitive processes
- Training runs and datasets for testing human-like reasoning and emotional frameworks
- Tools, logs, and benchmarks for evaluating growth and alignment over time

## Quick Start

Run a basic training loop:

```bash
python asi_model.py --steps 1000
