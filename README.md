# ArtificialSentience

ArtificialSentience is a research project by **Alan Hourmand** dedicated to building a human-like AI system.  
This repository will serve as the foundation for designing, training, and iterating on new models that push beyond conventional machine learning.  

## Vision

ArtificialSentience is a unique transformer architecture inspired by the human mind.  
Key focuses include:  
- **Parallel Thinking** – multiple reasoning streams working in unison  
- **Emotional Modeling** – simulated affective states to shape responses and goals  
- **Purpose & Growth** – long-term objectives, self-improvement, and adaptive learning  
- **Abstraction** – the ability to generalize and operate on higher-level concepts  

The ultimate aim is to move toward **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)** that combines advanced reasoning with empathy and human alignment. By merging capability with compassion, ArtificialSentience explores how AI can develop intelligence while maintaining safety, trust, and meaningful collaboration with people.  

## Development

This repo will hopefully host:  
- Experimental transformer architectures modeled after cognitive processes  
- Training runs and datasets for testing human-like reasoning and emotional frameworks  
- Tools, logs, and benchmarks for evaluating growth and alignment over time
